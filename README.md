# Discord messages auto deleter

Small non-optimized tool (initially made of a friend) that takes advantage of Discord's API to allow a user to mass delete their own messages.

## Requirements
- `request` module

## Disclosure
I take no responsibility for the use of this program. Use wisely. May break Discord's TOS.
